# Banking-Management-System
# 🏦 Python Banking System

A simple yet powerful console-based banking system built in Python that simulates real-world banking operations. This project supports account management, transaction history, balance inquiries, binary search, and even hierarchical access control via tree structures.

## ✨ Features

- 📥 Create, Update, and Delete bank accounts
- 💵 Deposit, Withdraw, and Transfer money between accounts
- 📄 View Transaction History (last 20 using `deque`)
- 🔍 Binary Search for account lookup
- 📊 Generate report of accounts sorted by balance using Merge Sort
- 🌳 Model Organizational Hierarchy using Tree (CEO → Managers → Employees)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Classes & Objects**
- **Data Structures:**
  - `List` for storing accounts
  - `deque` for transaction history
  - `Tree` for hierarchy modeling
- **Algorithms:**
  - Binary Search
  - Merge Sort

--- Account Report (Sorted by Balance) ---
- 102: Bob Jr. - Balance: $700
- 101: Alice - Balance: $1200
- 103: Charlie - Balance: $900

--- Transactions ---
- Deposited $200 to 101
- Withdrew $100 from 102
- Transferred $300 from 103 to 102

--- Organizational Hierarchy ---
- CEO
  - CTO
    - Dev Manager
  - CFO
    - Accounting Manager

## ✅ Learning Outcomes
